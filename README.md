## HDLBits Verilog Practice

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Verilog problems on the HDLBits website, an excellent platform for practicing digital design and Verilog.

âœ… Completed Sections

Solutions for the following sections have been completed and are available in this repository:

    1. Getting Started

        An introduction to using the HDLBits platform.

    2. Verilog Language

        Problems covering the fundamental syntax and features of the Verilog language.

    3. Combinational Logic

        Designs including logic gates, modules, vectors, and combinational always blocks.

    4. Sequential Logic

        Designs involving flip-flops, counters.

ðŸš€ In Progress

I am actively working on solving problems from the remaining sections. This repository will be updated as I complete more modules.

Till then, keep learning and keep practising!
